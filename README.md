# Multinational IT Company Network Design – Sri Lanka Branch

## Overview
This project involves designing a comprehensive network for a multinational IT company's new overseas branch in Sri Lanka. The goal was to optimize the use of the provided IP address range while ensuring secure and efficient network operations. This project was completed as part of the **EC4060** course.

## Key Features
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Enhances security and optimizes network traffic.  
- **Router & Switch Configuration**: Ensures seamless inter-VLAN communication.  
- **WiFi Access Point Setup**: Provides full wireless coverage throughout the branch.  

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for network simulation and design  
- **VLAN Configuration** – to segment network traffic  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – to control and secure network access  

## Project Structure
- `Network Diagram` – Visual representation of the network topology  
- `Configuration Files` – Router, switch, and AP configurations  
- `Documentation` – Step-by-step guide for implementation  

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience in designing secure and efficient enterprise networks.  
- Learned to implement VLANs and ACLs for optimized traffic management.  
- Developed skills in configuring routers, switches, and wireless access points for real-world network scenarios.
